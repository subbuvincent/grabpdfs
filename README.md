# grabpdfs
Program to grab PDFs from a given URL. It will work for flag webpages with tons of links that have PDF files. Extensions .pdf not needed. But it will not work for JS or interactive websites or pages with nested pages that in turn have PDFs. 

# Original version 
The original version of this code came from author elssar (elssar@altrawcode.com) https://github.com/elssar. I am unable to find that code repository now so not linking that here. 

# Genesis use case
An investigative journalism team wanted to scrape all the Environmental Impact Report PDFs from multiple city juridisctions all across California. This program solved a part of that problem.
